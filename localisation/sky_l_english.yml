############################## Beginning #####################################
origins:0 "Origins of the Sky Reavers"
raidergang:0 "Raider Gang"
kronodeal:0 "Krono's Deal"
origins_desc:0 "The Sky Reavers used to be nothing more than another Raider outfit, rampaging with no direction or purpose. Their leaders were brutal, but indecisive. Things changed when Krono came along. They managed to kill the last leader in single combat and took everything he had, including the leadership of the Sky Reavers. Since then, they've whipped the Sky Reavers into a force to be reckoned with."
Buildingtheskyreavers:0 "Building the Sky Reavers"
Buildingtheskyreavers_desc: "One of the first things Krono changed was the organization of their freshly acquired outfit. They installed a group of trusted lieutenants that reported directly to them and made Krono's will clear to their forces, acting as the Sky Reaver's nervous system and establishing order among the troops."
domination:0 "Domination and Shows of Force"
sugarbread:0 "Carrot and Stick"
support:0 "Support and Example"
leader1:0 "Krono's Past"
leader1_desc:0 "While nobody who doesn't have a death wish will fuck with Krono, nothing is known of their identity. Before they travelled to the deserts around Area 51 and became the leader of the Sky Reavers, they had their share of experiences that defined them."
leader2:0 "Krono's Personality"
leader2_desc:0 "Getting to know Krono is one thing. Experiencing their rather unique personality is another. The Reavers didn't ask about their leader's decisions because asking the wrong questions at the wrong time is a very easy way to wind up dead. Krono's motives are known only to themself, and they know those motives well."
progress:0 "Progress"
wealth:0 "Wealth"
authority:0 "Authority"
Kronosambitions:0 "Krono's Ambitions"
Kronosambitions_desc:0 "With their new Officer Corps in place, Krono can turn their attention towards accomplishing their goals. These operations will have a scale larger than anything the Reavers have done before, and their impact on the future will be immeasurable."

############################## Reformation #####################################
reformation:0 "Reformation of the Sky Reavers"
reformation_desc:0 "Despite Krono's efforts, they are only at the beginning of what will become known as the Reformation. Changing a Gang's customs is a long, hard process. If it is completed however, the possible gains could outweigh any risks."
economyboost:0 "Stimulus Package"
economyboost_desc:0 "By giving some of our ill-gotten gains to the local population we can boost their productive capacity and expect a little something back in return; win-win I say."
economy:0 "Economy Law"
improvingloyalty:0 "Local Loyalties"
improvingloyalty_desc:0 "We've done our part to secure the loyalty of our civillian population, and we'll go one step further; we'll bring Darius Will, mayor of Crystal Springs, into our new government."
industryefforts:0 "Krono's Deal"
industryefforts_desc:0 "We've struck a deal with Crystal Springs; they work with us, build for us, and we'll give them a cut of our loot and keep them safe. Seems fair to Krono, and from their eager agreement, seems good to Crystal Springs too."
work:0 "Infrastructure Investments"
work_desc: "Sure infrastructure is good for moving quickly across an area, but know what else it's good for? Sick peope who need doctors. Hungry people who need food. Dying people who need comfort. By investing in the local infrastructure we help the people as much as we help ourselves."
raiding:0 "Raiding Caravans"
raiding_desc:0 "Raiding caravans is a proud and honest tradition of the Sky Reavers! Would boss really take that away from us?"
raidercamps:0 "Raider Camps"
raidercamps_desc: "Many of our more vicious bastards live in Raiding Camps, making their living the only honest way. Surely Krono will respect this way of life for our people."
proffessionalenslavement:0 "Slave Markets"
proffessionalenslavement_desc:0 "While slaves have never been a product of the Sky Reavers, they're profitable and there's a first time for everything, isn't there?"
draft:0 "Drafting Policy"
draft_desc:0 "Just because we're born of raiders doesn't mean only psychopaths have to join our ranks; start the conscription up, we need to recruit more regular folks into our new army."
fortifications1:0 "Keeping an eye on the Rangers"
fortifications1_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are perfectly poised to stab us in the back and destroy everything we've worked for. Whether or not we trust them, only idiots don't have contingency plans."
mobilization:0 "Preparing for War"
mobilization_desc:0 "Our economy is lackadaisy and our workers are roustabouts; it's time to whip this economy into a shape that's ready to fuel our war machine."
reavers_reformed:0 "Sky Reavers Reformed"
reavers_reformed_desc:0 "For better or worse, we've whipped our useless sacks of shit into shape and established ourselves, as a threat or as a legitimate state doesn't matter. The Reformation is complete; Krono has lead us into a prosperous new age."
############################## Diplomacy #####################################
diplomaticapp:0 "Diplomatic Approaches"
diplomaticapp_desc:0 "Expansionism is meaningless if it provokes unwanted attention from the major players that surround us. It would be prudent to make preparations and get in touch with at least one of the major powers to secure a stable future for the Reavers no matter the path we take."
dipvegas:0 "Reaching out to New Vegas"
dipvegas_desc:0 "New Vegas isn't large but ever since Mr House woke up he's been making waves over them there hills. If we can secure an alliance he'll hopefully cut us into a piece of whatever pie he's baking."
diplomatdr:0 "Approach the Desert Rangers"
diplomatdr_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are cover large tracts of land, hate raiders, and most importantly, are literally right on our doorstep. If we don't make nice with them, and quick, we might find ourselves on their hitlist quicker than we'd like."
diplomatncr:0 "Sending a Diplomat to the NCR"
diplomatncr_desc:0 "The NCR are the single greatest regional power that we know of. If we can somehow get them on our side, ain't nobody gonna fuck with us."
d5:0 "Ranger Agreement"
d5_desc:0 "The Rangers are a major threat to us but that doesn't mean we can't be friends. Let's see if we can come to some kind of arrangement with our dutiful, powerful friends."
d5b2:0 "For the Sake of Stability"
d5b2_desc:0 "Ambition is the enemy of greatness, and we've gotta swallow some of our pride; for the sake of stability in the region and peace for both our peoples, some sacrifices must be made."
d5a:0 "Volunteer Deployment"
d5a_desc:0 "The fight of the Desert Rangers is a never-ending, everlasting fight of order against chaos. We can contribute towards their war effort, showing them our true interest into being different from a simple raider outfit."
d5a2:0 "Expanding the Reaver Road"
d5a2:0 "If nations are bodies then roads are the arteries that pump the blood that is the populace around; in order to solidify our diplomatic relations we're gonna have to get ourselves ready for some blood transfusions."
d6:0 "Appealing to the NCR Congress"
d6_desc: "Regrettably, the NCR is a democracy, which means that if we want recognition and support we're going to need secure the support of key politicians and gain approval from the NCR's natonal congress."
d6a:0 "Supporting the NCR Effort"
d6a_desc:0 "The Bear of California is a beast that is willing and able to take care of its problems, but must be given time to do so. We could send them volunteer troops in order to help them take care of competing raider gangs that are currently harassing them. This would give them a reason to view us as more than just another pack of raiders."
d6a2:0 "Helping the Crimson Caravan"
d6a2_desc:0 "The Crimson Caravan is a politically powerful and well-connected organisation; one that is frequently the victim of raiders. If we can call our boys off them in our own territory and make sure no one else fucks with them outside it, we can get in good with the NCR."
d6b2:0 "Approval from Congress"
d6b2_desc:0 "All our schmoozing and bribing has come to head; it's time to seek approval from the NCR Congress!"
d7a:0 "A Security Force for Vegas"
d7a_desc:0 "Mr. House is the undisputed ruler of the New Vegas Strip. If we want to capture his attention and earn his good will, it would be beneficial to show him why we are respected and feared in combat by acting as supplementary strip security."
d7a2:0 "Building the Reaver Road"
d7a2_desc:0 "We've been learning some history, and we've learnt this; if you wanna be a great nation, you gotta have a road. Romans? Via Militaris. Mongolians? Silk Road. The Chinese? See before. Germans? Autobahn, boom. If we want to show the world we're a legitimate nation, we gotta build a road."
d7b:0 "A Deal with the House"
d7b_desc:0 "A deal with New Vegas is a deal with one man: Mr House. Mr House is no stranger to making deals with poor wayward souls such as ourselves; perhaps we can come to a gentleman's agreement?"
d7b2:0 "Dependencies and Guarantees"
d7b2_desc:0 "New Vegas is established but its small, and just like us it sits poised between two powers that eye it greedily; little guys have got to stick together right?"
d7_desc: "Test"
d8:0 "Nevada Pacified"
d8_desc:0 "Whether or not we secured what we wanted from the regional powers, we can hold our heads high with the knowledge that we've taken pains to seek recognition and legitimacy; we have sought a pacified, united Nevada."

migration1:0 "A Booming Settlement"
migration1_desc:0 "Our pacification and development of our homeland has lead to an influx of new settlers; this is obviously to our advantage."
migration2:0 "Settlers from the Wasteland"
migration2_desc:0 "They come in by hundreds; walking or crawling, some bright eyed, some dead on their feet, having finally made it here. It's the least that we can do to make our welcome clear."
############################## Area Development ##############################
militarypast:0 "Military Past"
militarypast_desc:0 "The region around Area 51 and Area 6 hides many secrets of the old world, quite famously. Fortunately for us, Krono has decided to take these places as their base of operations. While most secrets of the place remain unknown to us, it wont be long before we figure out the nastiest ones. We just need to kick our engineers into gear and figure out how to get them working."
areaaa:0 "Exploring Area 51"
areaaa_desc:0 "It will take some time and some men, but if we clear our the debris and the useless junk from Area 51, we can make way for some useful things: like armories!"
areaab:0 "Reconstruct the Comm System"
areaab_desc:0 "Let's get our clever bastards onto getting the radar and radio arrays working; that way we can shoot down enemy planes while listening to only the tastiest bops!"
areaabc:0 "Reclaim Staff Quarters"
areaabc_desc:0 "If we get the barracks cleaned out and ready for habitation we can convince some desperate bastards to come live in them; and serve in our military as rent."
depot:0 "Underground Depot"
depot_desc:0 "If we can find everything the depot is hiding we can make sure that we'll never want for guns, cars or bombs ever again. It'll take men and time, but it'll be worth it."
depot2:0 "Getting into the Armory"
depot2_desc:0 "There's something powerful and dangerous behind those doors, something we'd never be able to figure out on our own. I can damn near smell it. Spare the men and time and I'll bring you some pushkas like you've never seen."
depot3:0 "Advanced access to the Armory"
depot3_desc:0 "Yet another one of those sealed armouries; you know, the one which gave us guns which can shoot for miles? Come on boss, spare the men and I'll bring you the best toys you ever seen."
traininggrounds:0 "Army Library"
traininggrounds_desc:0 "There's a lot of knowledge here; a lot to be absorbed and read. Unluckily, most of us are morons. It'll take about five hundred of us to make total use of this places accumulated knowledge. Spare that, and I'll bring you some old world tactical knowledge to play with."
traininggrounds2:0 "Underground Training Facility"
traininggrounds2_desc:0 "I don't know how to explain this to you boss but there's a place underground where we can go to learn to fight better than anyone up top knows how to fight. There's flamethrowers and spike traps and stuff, it's pretty intense. Give me some goons to run through it to figure out exactly how it works and I'll give you a brutal experience like nothing you've ever done."
traininggrounds3:0 "Knowledge of the Past"
traininggrounds3_desc:0 "We're gonna figure out how to fight like they used. We're gonna become undisputed in our unit tactics. It's just like you dreamed boss; ain't nobody ready for a gang as organised and disciplined as us."
a61:0 "Scouting Area 6"
a61_desc:0 "Area 6 isn't in tatters like Area 51, and while it'll still take time and men to make it useable, there far more to use here."
a62:0 "Science Department"
a62_desc:0 "The eggheads found some research equipment in Area 6, if we can spare the men they can use clever kids and lab assistants to let us figure more stuff out quicker."
a63:0 "Hydroponics Research"
a63_desc:0 "So I know we're always struggling for food because we live in a fuckin' wasteland. Get this: the eggheads in Area 6 have figured out how to grow food underground. If you can spare the manpower we can develop this tech and get our population booming like never before."
a64:0 "Research Groups"
a64_desc:0 "The eggheads from Area 6 reckon that if we talk to our buddies about what they've figured out it should make figuring stuff out for ourselves easier. Seems like kind of a basic concept for it having taken them so long to figure out but I'm not an egghead so I can't judge."
a65:0 "Second Sky Reaver Base"
a65_desc:0 "With Area 6 fully staffed and running at high capacity the eggheads are getting uppity none more than ol' Frankie Manning, the Butcher. Watch out for him boss, I think he might be eyeing your spot. On the bright side though, we got more and better boys to help throw our weight around."
fullfilled:0 "Areas Reborn"
fullfilled_desc:0 "With the Areas fully cleared we've learned more from the old world than any other outfit, and that'll help us figure out things about the new world even quicker. We're gonna show the world that the Sky Reavers and their brainy selves are not to fucked with."

############################## Expansion #####################################

expand1:0 "Taking out the competition"
expand1_desc:0 "The Reavers are like any other Gang; give them something to fight and they are content. The Reavers face several competitors in the north and east. Perhaps its time to pay them a visit."
expand2:0 "Confront Grabbers"
expand2_desc: "These gropey little bastards have been sitting on our doorstep grousing and spitting in our face for far to long; it's time to rile the boys up and show them we are not to be fucked with."
expand2.a:0 "Take Everything From Them"
expand2.a_desc:"Crushing them in battle gave us an inch; now that we own their shit its time to take a mile. Rip it up and take it back to HQ boys."
expand2.b:0 "Integrate Grabber Territories"
expand2.b:0 "They're ours now; body, mind, soul, they belong to us. There ain't no 'Grabbers' no more, all that remains on this turf is reavers, hungry for war and ready to serve."
befriend1:0 "Approaching the Grabbers"
befriend1_desc:0 "This doesn't have to be violent, even if that is what the boys want; we're gonna do this the civilised way. We're gonna make a deal and talk things over like adults instead of 16 year olds with hard-ons and death wishes"
befriend1.a:0 "Unite the Grabbers"
befriend1.a_desc:0 "In a way that is all too familiar, the Grabbers are dealing with internal squabbles and questionable loyalties. If we're gonna bring 'em into the fold, first we gotta make sure they're in their own paddock, or something."
befriend1.b:0 "An Offer They Can't Refuse"
befriend1.c:0 "Grabber's Dream"

Freedom of the individual is not."

sky.0.d:0 "When Krono took over the raider gang, they held a speech to their new crew. Krono needed to confront the rabble with their past errors to make Krono's vision for a brighter future shine clear. Listening to that speech, the Sky Reavers knew that change was coming. What was the thrust of Krono's speech?"
sky.0.a:0 "Arguing that the Outfit was too small to make a difference and needed to conquer more territory."
sky.0.b:0 "That there would be no more squabbling between bosses; that Krono's word was now law"
sky.0.c:0 "Confronting them with how little they actually knew of warfare and how much Krono could teach them."
sky.1.t:0 "Officer directive"
sky.1.d:0 "As Krono installed the Lieutenants into their new leadership positions, they gave the Lieutenants a little advice on how exactly they should lead.".
sky.1.a:0 "Domination and shows of force are key".
sky.1.b:0 "Carrot and stick in equal measure"
sky.1.c:0 "Support them and be an example to them, ensuring their loyalty"

sky_raider.1.t:0 "Caravan Blues"
sky_raider.1.d:0 "One of the first questions we have to address is how to handle trespassing caravans. The Sky Reavers had a custom of outright plunder before Krono. Should that custom continue?"
sky_raider.1.a:0 "Continue raiding"
sky_raider.1.b:0 "Start offering caravans guidance and protection"
sky_raider.2.t:0 "Raider Camps"
sky_raider.2.d:0 "Due to the old ways the Sky Reavers, there are a number of minor settlements that subsist solely off the raiding of caravans and the trading of their ill gotten gains. What is Krono's verdict on these 'Raider Camps'?"
sky_raider.2.a:0 "Let the Camps remain as they are"
sky_raider.2.b:0 "Give them new employment. They will guide and protect caravans, not raid them."
sky_raider.3.t:0 "Slave Markets"
sky_raider.3.d:0 "Slave Markets are not part of our culture or custom, but they are a profitable business in this area. Should we start exploiting an untapped slave ecnomy?"
sky_raider.3.a:0 "Establish Slave Markets"
sky_raider.3.b:0 "Prohibit Slave Markets"
sky_events.11:0 "Raiding continues"
sky_raider.4.t:0 "Trade Problems"
sky_raider.4.d:0 "News has reached us that trade caravans attempting to use the route through the town of Crystal Springs have gone missing. Some say that this is because of increased raiding along the whole area, as some adventurers from there tell stories of heartless men that take everything they want - including lives of innocent people."
sky_raider.4.a:0 "Damn raiders".
sky_events.12:0 "Start paid caravan guiding"
sky_raider.5.t:0 "Strange Aid"
sky_raider.5.d:0 "News from various caravans got to us. The caravan leaders say that the trade route through the town of Crystal Springs is a harsh environment - but one in which certain people will actually guide the caravans around danger zones to safety for a fair price. Even more surprising is the rumor that continues to spread that these caravan guides refer to themselves as the former known raider outfit known as the Sky Reavers."
